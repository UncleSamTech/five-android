This build environment needs some work; hopefully when the Masa plugin is
updated we can do a better job of integrating these tests.

In the meantime, you must load the five-client project into Eclipse to build
the class files (in five-client/bin).  Then the provided Ant build script here
can be used to build/install the test package.  Once you are done installing it, instrumentation is achieved with the following command:

$ adb shell am instrument \
  -w org.devtcg.five.tests/android.test.InstrumentationTestRunner

Note that most of the tests require a functional setup of five-client,
synchronized with a real server.
